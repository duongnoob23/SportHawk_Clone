## What is SportHawk?

SportHawk is a mobile application designed to connect grassroots sports communities. It aims to simplify administrative tasks for volunteer-run clubs and teams, and help individual members easily find and engage with their club activities. It's built for players, clubs, coaches, and parents.

## How do I get the SportHawk app?

SportHawk is available for download on both the Apple App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android). Simply search for "SportHawk". However, we are hosting a limited number of teams whilst we undergo product development. Don't forget to join the waitlist.

## Is SportHawk free to use?

The SportHawk app is free for individual users to download and use its available features. For clubs, SportHawk charges a competitive 2.5% fee on payments processed through the app. Clubs can choose for the customer (payee) to cover this fee in addition to the base price, making it free for the club. Standard Stripe transaction fees (e.g., 1.5% \+ £0.20 for UK cards) are separate and covered by the club.

## What features are currently available in the app?

Currently, you can download SportHawk to create your profile, explore clubs and teams via list or map view, express interest in joining a team, use our social media space and manage your personal app settings and notification preferences. Full team management features for clubs are launching soon.

## How can my club or team use SportHawk for management?

Full team management features, including event scheduling, availability tracking, member management, player waitlists and one-off payment requests and tracking, are currently in closed testing and launching soon. Clubs and coaches can register teams on our website at 'Join the Waitlist' for early access or notification of broader launch.

## What payment methods does SportHawk support?

SportHawk integrates with Stripe to support one-off payments via major credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay directly within the app. We want to allow subscription based payments in the future, that offer flexible payment methods.

## Is my data safe with SportHawk?

Yes, data security is a top priority. SportHawk uses secure backend services (Supabase) with Row Level Security (RLS) on all sensitive data. All communication is over HTTPS, and sensitive information like raw card details are handled directly by Stripe, not SportHawk's servers. User data privacy is managed according to our Privacy Policy.
