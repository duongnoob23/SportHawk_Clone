**7\. Data Security & Retention**

**Data Security**

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. We have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, including using reputable third-party services like Supabase for our infrastructure. However, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

**Data Retention**

We will only retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. We will keep your data for as long as your account remains active.

If you choose to delete your account, we will permanently delete your personal information within **90 days** of your deletion request, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it.

**8\. International Data Transfers**

Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your country, where the data protection laws may differ from those in the UK.

Specifically, as we use service providers based in the United States (such as Supabase and Stripe), your data will be processed in the United States.

When we transfer your data to a country outside the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with UK data protection laws. These safeguards may include:

- Transferring data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK Government (such as through the **UK-US Data Bridge**).
- Using specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK (known as **Standard Contractual Clauses** or SCCs).

Our Services are not intended for or directed to individuals under the age of 16\. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16\.

Through our registration process, we have technical measures in place to prevent individuals who identify as being under 16 from creating an account.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at **privacy@sporthawkapp.com**.
